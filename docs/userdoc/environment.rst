Environment Variables
=====================

Here is a list of important environment variables you can set/override in one of your ``.env`` files:

  :SOURCE_PATH: The location of the main pipeline source code. Change this only if you want to use your own pipeline version as a developer. Warning: From there on you are responsible for the pipeline!
  :JUKEBOX_PLUGIN_PATH: The path where the pipeline will look for selfmade plugins. Seperate multiple paths with a semicolon.
