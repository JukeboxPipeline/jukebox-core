Configuration
=============

Inside the the pipeline user directory there is a config dir. You can edit the ``.ini`` -files inside there.
There is also a tool called configer, that lets you edit these files in an special editor that validates your input.
Some plugins and tools might provide own interfaces for editing their config data. They might also override some stuff while they are running (e.g. to save the last selection).
